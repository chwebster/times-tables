# Practise your times tables!

* This simple Python program sets 10 questions at random from any of the tables from 2 to 12.

* You will be given a mark out of 10 and a completion time, together with some praise and encouragement :slightly_smiling_face:.


## Installation

Two options:

1. Click the green "Clone or Download" button.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to where you want the download to go. Type

```
git clone https://github.com/chwebster/times-tables
```

Now you can run the program by typing

```
python times_tables.py
```


## Background

This was one of the first Python programs I wrote. It was a good exercise for me, and it also helped my kids learn their tables. There are lots of nice apps and websites out there that make times tables practice very colourful and engaging. However, most of them require you to click or tap on buttons. This is a different learning process to the action of typing in your answer using the number keys on a keyboard.

My simple Python program is not at all colourful, but it does make you type your answers on the keyboard, which means you can't just memorise the location of the button with the answer written on it, or memorise the colour of it. You have to think what the answer is and type it in. If you get it wrong, the program will tell you what the correct answer is to help you get it right next time.

If you are learning Python you might like to try playing around with this program. You could come up with some different encouragement or make a version that only sets questions from a limited set of tables, e.g. 2 to 5.

Have fun!
